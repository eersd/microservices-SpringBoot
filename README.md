# microservices-SpringBoot
Project to learn about microservices with SpringBoot. Plan is to create several microservices:

- catalog-service
- inventory-service
- order-service

These microservices will be registered with Netflix Eureka. A simple UI will also be integrated. Finally, will use docker to containerize the microservices
